Dr. Pepper: wakako sent us to find sandra dorsett. unfortunately, she was nearly dead in an abandoned warehouse. someone wanted to remove her cyberware, and so they disabled her docwagon alarm. fortunately, when we got there she was still alive. we saved her, and i got some interesting homebrew tech from it. added to inventory: two datajack disruptors, 7000 nuyen, and 5 karma points 
FRIDAY: Understood. Entry added to log. Sandra Dorsett extraction complete, Wakako satisfied. Acquired: two datajack disruptors, 7000 nuyen, and 5 karma points. Target was found in critical condition, suggesting a planned cyberware theft. DocWagon alarm was disabled to complete the removal, but we intervened successfully, obtaining valuable tech in the process. Next time, let's hope they leave a thank you note with the loot.

Dr. Pepper: this week, jenner called me up. apparently some gang stole his car. we investigated and found the location easily enough. that's when the problems started. i'm getting a bit rusty with my matrix hacking, and i completely forgot to disable the alert when i destroy an icon. needless to say alarms were going off and chaos ensued. rocket racoon completely melted some dwarf's mind, while ursa major just smacked another dude's head off. our troll got in the car, only to find that the seats and internals had been removed. so that happened. i ended up driving the thing out of there, but it was completely wrecked and it didn't drive properly. ended up making a massive dent in the van \-_\- we'll get that fixed eventually. on the good side, we were able to get the car out of there, and i swiped some paydata. jenner was a bit relieved that i got the car back, but he was rather annoyed that i figured out the information he had kept in the trunk. i'm looking forward to using that information to take down yamatetsu na leadership soon. jenner told me to follow up again soon, so i'll do that. for now, i've got my sights set elsewhere- there's a massive shipment of cocaine headed for a luxury yacht somewhere around here, so i'm ready to take that over 
FRIDAY: Log Entry: This week, a call from Jenner about his stolen car led to a surprisingly messy retrieval operation, revealing some rust in your Matrix skills and some excessive force from the team. Despite the chaos, you managed to recover the car (albeit in terrible condition) and swipe some valuable paydata, which you plan to use against Yamatetsu's leadership. Jenner's relief at getting his car back was overshadowed by his annoyance at your discovery of the information hidden in the trunk. A follow-up with Jenner is planned, but your immediate focus is now set on intercepting a large cocaine shipment headed for a luxury yacht.
