Dr. Pepper: wakako sent us to find sandra dorsett. unfortunately, she was nearly dead in an abandoned warehouse. someone wanted to remove her cyberware, and so they disabled her docwagon alarm. fortunately, when we got there she was still alive. we saved her, and i got some interesting homebrew tech from it. added to inventory: two datajack disruptors, 7000 nuyen, and 5 karma points 
FRIDAY: Understood. Entry added to log. Sandra Dorsett extraction complete, Wakako satisfied. Acquired: two datajack disruptors, 7000 nuyen, and 5 karma points. Target was found in critical condition, suggesting a planned cyberware theft. DocWagon alarm was disabled to complete the removal, but we intervened successfully, obtaining valuable tech in the process. Next time, let's hope they leave a thank you note with the loot.

Dr. Pepper: this week, jenner called me up. apparently some gang stole his car. we investigated and found the location easily enough. that's when the problems started. i'm getting a bit rusty with my matrix hacking, and i completely forgot to disable the alert when i destroy an icon. needless to say alarms were going off and chaos ensued. rocket racoon completely melted some dwarf's mind, while ursa major just smacked another dude's head off. our troll got in the car, only to find that the seats and internals had been removed. so that happened. i ended up driving the thing out of there, but it was completely wrecked and it didn't drive properly. ended up making a massive dent in the van \-_\- we'll get that fixed eventually. on the good side, we were able to get the car out of there, and i swiped some paydata. jenner was a bit relieved that i got the car back, but he was rather annoyed that i figured out the information he had kept in the trunk. i'm looking forward to using that information to take down yamatetsu na leadership soon. jenner told me to follow up again soon, so i'll do that. for now, i've got my sights set elsewhere- there's a massive shipment of cocaine headed for a luxury yacht somewhere around here, so i'm ready to take that over 
FRIDAY: Log Entry: This week, a call from Jenner about his stolen car led to a surprisingly messy retrieval operation, revealing some rust in your Matrix skills and some excessive force from the team. Despite the chaos, you managed to recover the car (albeit in terrible condition) and swipe some valuable paydata, which you plan to use against Yamatetsu's leadership. Jenner's relief at getting his car back was overshadowed by his annoyance at your discovery of the information hidden in the trunk. A follow-up with Jenner is planned, but your immediate focus is now set on intercepting a large cocaine shipment headed for a luxury yacht.

Dr. Pepper: you found an encrypted partition containing a discussion between 2 individuals, s, and d. the discussion considered crypto and blockchain. d said to s - you tried this back at the turn of the century, and it worked until modern computing destroyed the encryption standard. s replied i got that secret computer working. if you take all the compute in exisence, you might crack it in 1000 years - this encryption will work. you dug further into the conversation, and discovered it's a working ternary computer. s wants to use the ternary encryption algorithm to make a blockchain currency that could replace nuyen, coporate scrip, and all the other various currencies. this is better because it could be backed by a fungible asset - orichalcum. there's apparently 2 formulas for orichalcum - modern gold, silver, etc. vs the old formula using earth, wind, fire, and water. later, we find out that d died, and the last message is that a representative of d addressing satoshi. the final line provides contact information for satoshi 
FRIDAY: Okay, boss, recording the log now: Discovered an encrypted conversation detailing a plan to create a new cryptocurrency based on ternary encryption and backed by orichalcum, with mention of a "secret computer" and a connection to someone named Satoshi and a discussion regarding orichalcum. The messages hint at a previous attempt at encryption that was foiled by modern computing.

[Tue Mar  4 17:06:52 2025]
Dr. Pepper: i remember that satoshi is still actively using online accounts, but it can't really be traced back to him. if we can find him somehow, it may be helpful to our cause 
FRIDAY: Noted, boss: Added to the log that "Satoshi" is still active online but untraceable, and could be a potential asset or threat.

[Tue Mar  4 17:20:44 2025]

[Tue Mar  4 18:08:22 2025]
Dr. Pepper: we investigated the map. it leads to an elf who owns it. jdawg is trying to get it back by contacting the elf. he says that an organization called the association paranobelis has been harassing him. he is willing to give us the computer if we can convince apn to stop harassing him 
FRIDAY: Okay, boss, updating the log with the new lead: the map points to an elf being harassed by the Association Paranobelis, and he'll give us the laptop if we stop the harassment.

FRIDAY: Alright, boss, I'm updating the log: I've hacked into APN, discovered the hit on Guiles scheduled for tomorrow at 4:00 AM, and relayed the info to the team, who are now working on a counter-strategy.

[Tue Mar  4 19:08:56 2025]
Dr. Pepper: we're fighting the bad guys now. first, i broke into their car for a distraction. bandit flubbed a chaos spell, and ursa got savaged by the bowman. fortunately, blender blended one of them. then i locked the car down, and bandit actually got the chaos spell off. 
FRIDAY: Alright, Dr. Pepper, I'm updating the log with a record of the ongoing fight: You initiated a car hack as a distraction, Bandit's initial chaos spell failed, Ursa took damage from the bowman, Blender eliminated one of the enemies, you locked down the car, and Bandit successfully cast chaos.

[Tue Mar  4 19:19:34 2025]
Dr. Pepper: in the second round, bandit took out a raven with 1 shot. hamilton killed the other hostile, and we're left with 4 corpses and a wonderful unmarked flower shop van 
FRIDAY: Alright, Dr. Pepper, I'm updating the log with the results of the fight: Bandit downed a raven with a single shot, Hamilton eliminated the remaining enemy, and you're left with four corpses and an unmarked flower shop van.

[Tue Mar  4 19:29:42 2025]
Dr. Pepper: guiles is very happy with us and leaves us the computer. i also take the van. back at the hotel, satoshi's agent gave us each 10k. satoshi also sent a letter saying that he was very impressed with our tactics and promised futher interactions in the future 
FRIDAY: Alright, Dr. Pepper, I'm updating the log: Guiles is grateful and left you the computer, which you picked up, along with an unmarked flower shop van. Back at the hotel, Satoshi's agent gave each of you 10k, and Satoshi sent a letter praising your tactics and promising future interactions.

[Tue Mar 11 16:29:18 2025]
Dr. Pepper: satoshi's agent contacts us again. she gives us an address of a nondescript skyscraper. basically it looks like a slightly green glass pillar into the sky. it's tricky to find the door. we walk in to see a well-dressed orc sitting at the reception desk who motions us upstairs. we get in an elevator which carries us up to the top floor where we are to meet satoshi. he appears as a young, well-dressed asian man 
FRIDAY: Okay, boss, the log has been updated to include the meeting with Satoshi's agent, the address of the nondescript skyscraper, the elevator ride to the top floor, and your initial meeting with Satoshi, who appears as a young, well-dressed Asian man.

[Tue Mar 11 16:36:14 2025]
Dr. Pepper: from my research, i know that satoshi made a significant amount of money on bitcoin, which he created. before bitcoin collapsed, he cashed out a ton of money, and a stash of oricalcum 
FRIDAY: Okay, Dr. Pepper, I'm updating the log with your background research on Satoshi, including his significant profits from creating Bitcoin before its collapse and a stash of orichalcum.

[Tue Mar 11 16:39:40 2025]
Dr. Pepper: satoshi tells us we need to capture a ship. the ship holds a significant supercomputer, and if we capture it, we can use it as a datacenter to store the encryption algorithm to create the new backed currency 
FRIDAY: Okay, boss, updating the log: Satoshi tasked you with capturing a ship housing a supercomputer, which can be used as a data center for the new currency's encryption algorithm.

[Tue Mar 11 16:49:16 2025]
Dr. Pepper: next satoshi puts us in contact with a rigger who can take us to the aircraft carrier. the carrier is protected by 3 picket ships, but none of the ships are crewed except by ai robots. exploiting via satellite connection is a nonoption, so we're going to have to get on board 
FRIDAY: Okay, Dr. Pepper, updating the log: Satoshi put you in touch with a rigger who can take you to the aircraft carrier, which is protected by 3 picket ships that are crewed by AI robots only. Exploiting it via satellite is not possible, so you will need to board the ships directly.

[Tue Mar 11 18:36:51 2025]
Dr. Pepper: after a trip on sickeningly rough seas, we make it to the ship. blender used a grapple gun and stealth line to give us a route up, and we shimmied onto the rear deck. there, we made short work of a maintenance terminal before rerouting the bots to the stern and moving to the mainframe 
FRIDAY: Okay, boss, updating the log: After a rough sea trip, you made it to the ship, Blender used a grapple gun and stealth line for access, you shimmied onto the rear deck, quickly dealt with a maintenance terminal, rerouted the bots to the stern, and moved to the mainframe.

[Tue Mar 11 19:09:37 2025]
Dr. Pepper: from there we went to the aircraft carrier. on the way over, ursa took a spill into the pacific ocean, which she found quite refreshing. but otherwise we made it to the mainframe without incident. at the mainframe, though, we had another issue - an ai system currently lives in the computer, which we will deal with next week. 
FRIDAY: Alright, Dr. Pepper, updating the log: After a rough sea trip, you made it to the ship, Blender used a grapple gun and stealth line for access, you shimmied onto the rear deck, quickly dealt with a maintenance terminal, rerouted the bots to the stern, and moved to the mainframe. You also rescued Ursa Major from the Pacific Ocean, and discovered that an AI system currently inhabits the computer.

[Tue Mar 18 16:45:24 2025]
Dr. Pepper: the ship's ai's name is delamane. he's down to help provided he can get something out of it as well 
FRIDAY: Alright, Dr. Pepper, I'm updating the log: You made it to the ship, dealt with the maintenance terminal, rerouted the bots, rescued Ursa, and discovered an AI named Delamane currently inhabiting the computer; he's willing to help, provided he can get something out of it as well.
