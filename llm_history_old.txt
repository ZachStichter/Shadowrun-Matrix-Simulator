[ROB]: friday what day is it?
[FRIDAY]: It's whatever day you need it to be, but according to my internal clock, it's Thursday.
[ROB]: hmm. that's strange. i thought it was saturday. are you sure your clock is correct?
[FRIDAY]: Well, unless you've invented a time machine I'm unaware of, yes, I'm quite sure.
[ROB]: hmm. that's strange. no matter. friday, we've got a big job coming up on tuesday. my partners and i are going to infiltrate a coke smuggling ring and steal their products for ourselves. our team is as follows: there's me, dr. pepper. i'm a hacker and matrix user who has a phd in biology and who is an expert in xenobiology. we've got hamilton, a troll who is incredibly charismatic and incredibly ugly. he's good with a gun. we've got jdawg. tbh i'm not sure what all he does. mostly just talks with people and hangs out. we've got ursa major, a were-polar-bear who needs to remember she's not a care bear. lastly, we've got rocket raccoon, the raccoon shaman who loves fireballing people and also melting their minds with a confusion spell. what do you recommend for our plan of attack?
[FRIDAY]: Given your team's unique talents, a multi-pronged approach is best, though I'd remind Ursa Major that "mauling" is not always the answer.
[ROB]: well yeah, I guess. problem is, ursa's our tank. She's a 10 foot tall 1200 lb polar bear with giant claws. we kind of need her to be in the front of the fight being a tank, but she always thinks she needs to run away. she *should* be mauling people. that's what she does best
[FRIDAY]: Maybe a motivational speech before the op?
[ROB]: hmm, that's a good thought. suggest one for me?
[FRIDAY]: Alright, try this: "Remember, Ursa, you're not just a bear; you're a walking, talking, claw-swinging fortress, so let's make sure those coke dealers learn to fear the fur."
[ROB]: hmm, that's pretty good. I think I'll share that with the group. Any other words of encouragement for the team?
[FRIDAY]: Just remind Hamilton to try charming the guards *before* he shoots them and Rocket Raccoon, please aim for "incapacitated," not "incinerated."
